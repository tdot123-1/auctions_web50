## About the project

This is a web application that functions as an online auction place. It was a part of the "CS50 - Web Development" course on Edx. 
The exercise was intended for practice with handling requests, database queries, and working with the Django framework. 
The "login" and "register" functions were provided by the exercise, all the rest was done by me.

## Functionalities

- Users are able to create an account, 
- put items up for auction, 
- make bids on items, 
- add items to their personal watchlist,
- close auctions that they own, 
- leave comments on listings,
- respond to other comments,
- view all currently active listings,
- search for specific items, 
- and search by category.

For testing I made several accounts to create listings, make bids, leave comments etc. 

## Technologies

This app was created with the Django web framework for Python.

Some Bootstrap components were utilized.
